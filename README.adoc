dessert
=======

The name is a short form of **de**pendency a**ssert**. Hence Dessert is a library to check assertions for
dependencies. It is intended to be used within unit-tests.

Features
--------

- Checking dependency rules
- Detection of cyclic dependencies

Goals
-----

- No additional dependencies but plain Java 6 or above
- Simple and intuitive API (motivated by [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/))
- Assertions should be robust against refactorings (no strings for class or package names required)
- Easy and seamless integration with other testing or assertion frameworks
- Speed

Getting Started
---------------

After having included the test dependency `com.github.hajo70:dessert:0.3` from the
`https://jitpack.io` repository a test checking all dependencies of the dessert library can
be implemented like this:

    @Test
    public void checkDessertDependencies() throws IOException {
        SliceContext sc = new SliceContext();
        Slice dessert = sc.packageTreeOf("de.spricom.dessert")
                .without(sc.packageTreeOf("de.spricom.dessert.test"));
        Slice java = sc.packageTreeOf("java");
        SliceAssertions.assertThat(dessert).usesOnly(java);
    }

### Minimal Maven POM

A copy of the following Maven POM can be used to get started with dessert:

### Minimal Gradle Buildfile

The corresponding Gradle build file looks like this:

    apply plugin: 'java'
    
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
    
    dependencies {
        testCompile 'com.github.hajo70:dessert:0.3'
        testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    }

### Samples

There is a separate [dessert-samples](https://github.com/hajo70/dessert-samples) project
showing how to use dessert with features of Java 8.

Basics
======

Classes and their dependencies
------------------------------

The goal of dependency checking is finding unwanted dependencies. Dessert does this be analyzing
.class files. The java compiler generates a .class file for each

- class
- interface
- annotation
- (anonymous) innerclass or inner interface
- enum class

*Note: A java source file can define more than one class.*

Such a .class file X depends on another .class file Y if X uses Y, thus

- X extends or implements Y
- X has a field of type Y, 
- X uses Y in a method signature (parameter, return value, throws clause)
- X has a local variable of Y
- X uses a (static) method of Y (direct call or method reference)
- X throws Y
- X implements Y within a Î»-expression
- X is an inner class of Y (or the other way round)
- X uses generic type of Y
- X is annotated with Y
- X uses Y as an annotation parameter

*Note:*
- Import statements are no relevant, because they don't appear in a .class file.
- It's not possible to detect all of these uses (i. e. local variables, method references)
  by reflection.
- Jdeps does not consider classes used in annotation parameters as a dependency, but dessert does
  (see [JDK-8134625](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8134625)).
- The compiler my have removed some source dependency that cannot be detected in the .class file
  anymore.

Building Blocks
---------------

In a clean software design each class belongs to some building block. Each build block has
defined interfaces and clear dependencies. In complex systems building blocks may be composed
from other building blocks or they may be organized in layers or vertical slices.

Ideally there is a clear and intuitive mapping between the physical package structure and the
building blocks of a software:

![Structural Architecture](structural-architecture.svg)

Dessert helps you to move towards such a clean software design and alarms you immediately 
if you are moving backward.

Main Elements of the Dessert API
--------------------------------

#### Slice
For dessert your software is just a bunch of classes. Hence you have to cut it down to
pieces that make up building blocks. In dessert such a piece is a called a `Slice`. 
A `Slice` is an arbitrary slice of the set of all classes that belong to a software.
A `Slice` is immutable. The method `slice` can be used to create as smaller `Slice` from
a existing `Slice`. Two slices can be combined with the methods `with` (union) and
`without` (difference) to a new `Slice`.  

#### SliceEntry
Each `SliceEntry` represents a .class file. It has methods like `getClassName()` or
`getClazz()` to access the details of the .class to be used for predicates. It's most
important method is `getUsedClasses()` which is used by the `SliceAssertions`.

#### SliceContext
The `SliceContext` is the entry point to dessert, a factory for slices. To get your
initial slices you can use the methods `packageOf`, `packageTreeOf` or `sliceOf`. 
The `SliceContext` implements the fly-weight pattern for slice entries. Hence for
two 'SliceEntry' objects x and y that originate from the same `SliceContext`
x.equals(y) is equivalent to x == y. Of nothing else is specified the `SliceContext`
operates on the current class-path.

#### SliceAssertions
`SliceAssertions` is a utility class that provides a fluent API with static methods
analogous to [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/). It's most important
method is `assertThat` or it's synonym `dessert`, so that it can be used with static
imports without conflicting with AssertJ. The most important methods of the fluent API
are `doesNotUse`, `usesOnly` or the combination of `uses`, `and` and `only()`.

Groups and Cycles
-----------------

The problem with a dependency cycle is: there is no starting point. Thus, you cannot use
or test a class involved in a cycle without having all other classes available. (By using
a mocking framework limited testing of an isolated class is possible.) Small 
cycles between classes are often necessary, but big intertwined cycles make your software
a ball of wool. In such an environment testing is a nightmare because each simple test
needs a very complex setup that initializes all parts of the software. It is not possible
to re-use such a software without replicating the whole infrastructure with all its system
requirements, even if only a small part is required.

#### SliceGroup
For cycle detection dessert provides the concept of a `SliceGroup`. As the name says, a
`SliceGroup` is a group of `Slice` objects. The `SliceGroup` has the static convenience
factory methods `splitByPackage` and `splitByEntry` to split up a `Slice` into smaller
corresponding slices. By providing a `SlicePartioner` an arbitrary criterium can be used
to split up a `Slice`. All `SliceEntry` objects the `partKey` method maps to the same
string will be in the same `Slice`.

#### Cycle detection
To detect cycles for a `SliceGroup` *sg* you can use:

    SliceGroup<PackageSlice> sg = SliceGroup.splitByPackage(slice);
    SliceAssertions.dessert(sg).isCycleFree();

This can be shortend to:

    SliceAssertions.dessert(slice).splitByPackage().isCycleFree();

#### Enforcing nesting rules
One method to prevent package cycles is establishing dependency rules for nested packages. For
example dessert follows the rule a deeper nested package must not use a class from it's parent
package. `SliceGroup` implements the `Iterator` interface, hence the following code can be used
to enforce this rule:

    Slice slice = new SliceContext().packageTreeOf("de.spricom.dessert");
    SliceGroup<PackageSlice> packages = SliceGroup.splitByPackage(slice);

    packages.forEach(pckg -> SliceAssertions.assertThat(pckg)
            .doesNotUse(pckg.getParentPackage(packages)));

The code above disallows only dependencies to direct parent packages. To disallow dependencies
to any ancestor package one could write:

    Slice slice = new SliceContext().packageTreeOf("de.spricom.dessert");
    SliceGroup<PackageSlice> packages = SliceGroup.splitByPackage(slice);

    packages.forEach(pckg -> SliceAssertions.assertThat(pckg)
            .doesNotUse(slice.slice(entry -> pckg.getParentPackageName().startsWith(entry.getPackageName()))));

Duplicates
----------

A common source of errors are duplicate .class files on the class-path. To load a class only it's fully qualified
name is required. Therefore, the ClassLoader scans the entries on the class-path for the first .class file with
that name. Thus, the order on the class-path matters. The same .class file may appear in different libraries and
the one loaded by the ClassLoader may not be the one you want.

For dessert two `SliceEntry` objects are only equal if they point to the same .class file, thus their `getURI`
method returns the same value. The ``getAlternatives()`` method returns all `SliceEntry` objects found by dessert
that have the same fully qualified classname. Ideally there is only one alternative - the `SliceEntry` itself.

By default the `SliceContext` scans the whole class-path and finds all duplicates (to be precise it scans all
jar's and class-directories visible to its `Resolver`). The `duplicates` method returns a `Slice` containing
all duplicates. Hence the following code can be used to ensure there are none:   

    ConcreteSlice duplicates = new SliceContext().duplicates();
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    duplicates.getSliceEntries().forEach(entry -> sb.append(entry.getURI()).append("\n"));
    assertThat(duplicates.getSliceEntries()).as(sb.toString()).isEmpty();

*Note: The `SliceEntry` method `getClazz()` uses the system classloader to load a class with the corresponding
name. Hence it always returns the same implementation and not necessarily the one that corresponds the 
`SliceEntry`'s .class file. This will be fixed in a future version.*

*Note: When dependency checking considers always all `SliceEntry` objects that belong to the `Slice` even if
some are duplicates.*

Examples
========

Besides the samples given for [cycle detection](#cycle-detection) and finding [duplicates](#duplicates) here
are some typical samples of using dessert.

Architecture verification and documentation
-------------------------------------------

Each architecture verification requires two steps:

1. Defining the building blocks
2. Checking dependencies between these building blocks

For example the [spring batch architecture](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/trunk/reference/html/spring-batch-intro.html#springBatchArchitecture)
could be verified like this:

    SliceContext sc = new SliceContext();

    // defining the building blocks of spring-batch
    Slice springBatchCore = sc.packageTreeOf("org.springframework.batch.core");
    Slice springBatchTest = sc.packageTreeOf("org.springframework.batch.test");
    Slice springBatchInfrastructure =
            sc.packageTreeOf("org.springframework.batch")
                    .without(springBatchCore)
                    .without(springBatchTest);

    // checking for disallowed dependencies
    SliceAssertions.assertThat(springBatchInfrastructure).doesNotUse(springBatchCore);

The package name can be replaced by a class located in the package. This makes the code more robust
against refactorings, but harder to read:

    Slice springBatchCore = sc.packageTreeOf(Job.class);
    Slice springBatchTest = sc.packageTreeOf(StepRunner.class);

The methods `doesNotUse` and `usesOnly` accept any number of building blocks:

    SliceAssertions.assertThat(springBatchInfrastructure).doesNotUse(springBatchCore, springBatchTest);

For `usesOnly` there is a fluent alternative for a long list of dependencies:  

    SliceContext sc = new SliceContext();
    Slice springBatchCore = sc.packageTreeOf(Job.class);
    
    // make sure a building block does not introduce unintended dependencies
    SliceAssertions.assertThat(springBatchCore)
            .uses(sc.packageTreeOf("org.springframework"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("java"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("org.apache.commons.logging"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("org.aspectj.lang.annotation"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("org.aopalliance"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("com.thoughtworks.xstream"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("com.fasterxml.jackson"))
            .and(sc.packageTreeOf("org.w3c.dom"))
            .only();

Such a test not only verifies the architecture but it also documents it. 

Verifying an implementation pattern
-----------------------------------

The motivation of the [MVP pattern in GWT applications](http://www.gwtproject.org/articles/mvp-architecture.html)
was to separate view code that requires a JavaScript environment from view logic that is executable in a pure
Java environment and can be tested by simple unit-tests. Therefore, the presenter must use the view implementation
only through an interface. This can be checked like this: 

    Slice presenters = mvp.slice(se -> se.getClassName().endsWith("Presenter"));
    Slice views = mvp.slice(se -> se.getClassName().endsWith("ViewImpl"));
    assertThat(presenters).doesNotUse(views);

The sample above assumes a naming conventions for presenters and view implementations. Alternatively presenters
and view implementations can be recognized by an interface they implement or a superclass they extend:

    Slice presenters = mvp.slice(se -> Presenter.class.isAssignableFrom(se.getClazz()));
    Slice views = mvp.slice(se -> ViewBase.class.isAssignableFrom(se.getClazz()));

This sample shows that a `Slice` can be an arbitrary set of classes, it's not tied to a building block.    

Detecting Usage of internal Classes
-----------------------------------

Every library has a public API and some internal classes required by the library itself to accomplish
its task. These internal classes should not be used by other applications, because they are subject to
change without notice. Before Java 9 there was no way to make sure no internal classes are used. Dessert
can detect such usages even in older versions of Java. For example, if you want to migrate your software
to Java 9 you should make sure no internal JDK classes are used. This can be done like this: 

    SliceContext sc = new SliceContext();
    Slice dessert = sc.packageTreeOf("de.spricom.dessert");

    assertThat(dessert).doesNotUse(
            sc.packageTreeOf("com.sun"),
            sc.packageTreeOf("sun"));

It's better practice to explicitly specify the allowed packages than to specify what is not allowed:

        assertThat(dessert).usesOnly(sc.packageTreeOf("java"));
 
Explorative Analyzation of Libraries
------------------------------------

Typically each library comes with a bunch of dependencies. Even worse, some frameworks (i. e. Spring Boot)
initialize and start services if some library appears on the class-path. Let's say you want to convert
an CSV file to XML. Therefore, you want to use the corresponding item-reader and -writer of Spring Batch
without all the overhead of the framework. To find out what dependencies you need for that case you could
use the following code:

    SliceContext sc = new SliceContext();
    Slice batchItemInfra = sc.packageTreeOf("org.springframework.batch.item.file")
            .with(sc.packageTreeOf("org.springframework.batch.item.xml"));

    dessert(batchItemInfra).uses(sc.packageTreeOf("java")).only();
    
The resulting failure lists all dependencies besides the Java runtime classes.
