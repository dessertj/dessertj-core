= The Dessert Library

The name is a short form of **de**pendency a**ssert**. Hence Dessert is a library to check assertions for
dependencies. It is intended to be used within unit-tests.

== Goals

- No additional dependencies but plain Java 6 or above (with full support for Java 15)
- Simple and intuitive API (motivated by [AssertJ](https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/))
- Assertions should be robust against refactorings (no strings for class or package names required)
- Easy and seamless integration with other testing or assertion frameworks
- Speed
